# Multithreaded Matlab

If your code makes use of the Parallel Computing Toolbox (e.g., parfor) or you have intense computations that can benefit from the built-in multi-threading provided by MATLAB's BLAS implementation, 
then you can run in multi-threaded mode. One can use up to all the CPU-cores on a single node in this mode.
