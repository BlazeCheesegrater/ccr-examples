# Basic Slurm Job

The example Slurm script [BasicExample.sh](BasicExample.sh) can be used to submit a basic job in an HPC environment. It highlights key features such as cluster, partition, memory requirements, and more. The `echo` statement on line 25 is an example of a command being run; this is where you would include whatever commands you want your job to execute.
