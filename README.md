# CCR Examples

This repository contains examples for use on UB CCR's high performance computing clusters.  These should be used in conjuction with CCR's documentation - https://docs.ccr.buffalo.edu - where the concepts and policies for using CCR's systems are explained.  There is additional information provided in recorded workshops on CCR's YouTube channel - https://youtube.com/@ubccr  

This repo will be updated regularly though there is always a chance information contained herein is inaccurate.  Please report any issues by filing a bug report, or even better, file a pull request with a fix!  Please note that although you will see some application specific Slurm scripts or container instructions, this repo does not contain an example for every piece of software installed on CCR's systems.  Users are expected to use the examples in the introductory section to modify for their application usage as appropriate.  If you have questions or run into problems, please submit a ticket to CCR Help, rather than submit an issue in Github.
