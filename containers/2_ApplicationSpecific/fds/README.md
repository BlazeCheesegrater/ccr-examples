# Example FDS container  

The Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS) is a large-eddy simulation (LES) code for low-speed flows, with an emphasis on smoke and heat transport from fires.  For more information on this program, visit the [website](https://pages.nist.gov/fds-smv/).  The easiest way to run FDS in CCR's HPC environment is using a container. Docker containers are available via this [third party](https://hub.docker.com/r/satcomx00/fds) and version 6.7.9 was tested for this example.  This container includes Intel MPI Library 2021.6.  CCR's `ccrsoft/2023.01` [software environment](https://docs.ccr.buffalo.edu/en/latest/software/releases/#202301) includes a module for `intel/2022.00` which includes `impi 2021.5.0`  These two versions of MPI are alike enough that this container works when loading the `intel/2022.00` module.  However, the user should be aware with future versions of FDS and CCR's intel modules, that you must align MPI versions on the system with the container in order for them to work properly.  See [here](https://docs.ccr.buffalo.edu/en/latest/howto/containerization/#building-mpi-enabled-images) for more info.

## Pulling the container  

Please refer to CCR's [container documentation](https://docs.ccr.buffalo.edu/en/latest/howto/containerization/) for information on using Apptainer.  This example shows how to pull a container from Docker Hub and convert it to an Apptainer image file.  This can be done from a [compile node or a compute node](https://docs.ccr.buffalo.edu/en/latest/hpc/clusters/#node-types).  Apptainer is not available on the CCR login nodes.  

```
CCRusername@login:~$ ssh compile  
CCRusername@compile:~$ cd /projects/academic/[YourGroupName]/[CCRusername]  
CCRusername@compile:~$ mkdir cache  
CCRusername@compile:~$ export APPTAINER_CACHEDIR=/projects/academic/[YourGroupName]/[CCRusername]/cache
CCRusername@compile:~$ apptainer pull docker://satcomx00/fds:6.7.9
```
This will save the Apptainer image as `fds_6.7.9.sif` in your current working directory.  


## Running the container image  

You can run FDS either in an interactive job or non-interactively by using a batch script (recommended).  

### Interactive option  

Please refer to our documentation on [running jobs](https://docs.ccr.buffalo.edu/en/latest/hpc/jobs/#interactive-job-submission) for more information.  This is provided as an example only and not all users will have access to the resources in this example.  The [`radiator.fds`](radiator.fds) input file is taken from the FDS website and used as an example.  This will run on, at most, 3 tasks.  Your real world work may scale to more tasks. Please refer to the Slurm options file and examples for running batch scripts as shown in our [Slurm examples repository](../../../slurm/README.md)    

```
CCRusername@login:~$ salloc --cluster=[CLUSTER] --partition=[PARTITION] --qos=[QOS] --account=[SlurmAccountName] --mem=6GB --nodes=1 --tasks=3 --time=01:00:00 --no-shell  
salloc: Pending job allocation 22013901

CCRusername@login:~$ module load intel

### Batch script option  

Using the [`fds-example.sh`](fds-example.sh) script as an example, modify the settings to meet your needs.  FDS is capable of running across multiple nodes but this should only be utilized if your problem requires more than the number of CPUs in a compute node.  Running FDS across multiple nodes will increase the time it takes for your problem to compute.  The specifications for available compute nodes in CCR's UB-HPC cluster can be found [here](https://docs.ccr.buffalo.edu/en/latest/hpc/clusters/#ub-hpc-detailed-hardware-specifications).  Please refer to the Slurm options file and examples for running batch scripts as shown in our [Slurm examples repository](../../../slurm/README.md) for more details.  Please also refer to the [FDS documentation](https://pages.nist.gov/fds-smv/manuals.html) to properly setup your requests for CPUs and tasks.
