# Example Micro-C Pipeline container

## Building the container

A brief guide to building the openff-toolkit container follows:<br/>
Please refer to CCR's [container documentation](https://docs.ccr.buffalo.edu/en/latest/howto/containerization/) for more detailed information on building and using Apptainer.

1. Start an interactive job

Apptainer is not available on the CCR login nodes and the compile nodes may not provide enough resources for you to build a container.  We recommend requesting an interactive job on a compute node to conduct this build process.<br/>
See CCR docs for more info on [running jobs](https://docs.ccr.buffalo.edu/en/latest/hpc/jobs/#interactive-job-submission)

```
$ salloc --cluster=ub-hpc --partition=debug --qos=debug --exclusive --time=01:00:00
salloc: Pending job allocation 19781052
salloc: job 19781052 queued and waiting for resources
salloc: job 19781052 has been allocated resources
salloc: Granted job allocation 19781052
salloc: Nodes cpn-i14-39 are ready for job
CCRusername@cpn-i14-39:~$ 

```

2. Navigate to your build directory & set a temp directory for cache

You should now be on the compute node allocated to you.  In this example we're using our project directory for our build directory.  Ensure you've placed your `openff-toolkit.def` and `environment.yml` file in your build directory

```
CCRusername@cpn-i14-39:~$ cd /projects/academic/[YourGroupName]/[CCRusername]
CCRusername@cpn-i14-39:~$ mkdir cache
CCRusername@cpn-i14-39:~$ export APPTAINER_CACHEDIR=/projects/academic/[YourGroupName]/[CCRusername]/cache

```

3. Build your container

```
CCRusername@cpn-i14-39:~$ apptainer build Micro-C-$(arch).sif Micro-C.def
...
...
INFO:    Adding environment to container
INFO:    Creating SIF file...
INFO:    Build complete: Micro-C-x86_64.sif
```

## Running the container

Start an interactive job e.g.

```
$ salloc --cluster=ub-hpc --partition=general-compute --qos=general-compute --mem=128GB --nodes=1 --cpus-per-task=1 --tasks-per-node=32 --time=05:00:00
```

...then run the container


```
CCRusername@cpn-q06-35-02:~$ cd /projects/academic/[YourGroupName]/[CCRusername]
CCRusername@cpn-q06-35-02:~$ apptainer shell -B /util:/util,/scratch:/scratch,/projects:/projects Micro-C-$(arch).sif
Apptainer>  
```

To download the HTML documents - from the Apptainer> prompt:

```
pushd /var/tmp
mkdir Micro-C_html
cd Micro-C_html/
(cd /opt/Micro-C/HiChiP/docs/build && tar cf - --transform 's|^html|HiChiP/|' html/) | tar xf -
(cd /opt/Micro-C/docs/build && tar cf - --transform 's|^html|Micro-C/|' html/) | tar xf -
cd ..
rm -f ~/Micro-C_html.zip
zip -r ~/Micro-C_html.zip Micro-C_html/
rm -rf Micro-C_html/
popd
```

This will create a Micro-C_html.zip file in your home directory
you can download this, then expand the zip file on your computer and
view the files e.g. on a Mac

Open a Terminal e.g. [Utilities] [Terminal.app]
```
cd ~/Downloads
scp [CCRuser]@vortex.ccr.buffalo.edu:Micro-C_html.zip .
unzip Micro-C_html.zip
```
In Finder go to [Downloads] [Micro-C_html]
In both the [HiChiP] and the [Micro-C] directories, click on the "index.html" file

All the commands in the Micro-C docs should run as they appear in these docs
(paths have been changed to refer to the location of tools in the container)
